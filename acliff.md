My name is Ashley Cliff and I am a graduate student in the Data Science and Engineering program through the Bredesen Center. I am a GRA in a CompBio group at ORNL where I focus on HPC algorithm implementation. I am interested in algorithm development and implementation to utilize exascale parallel computing.
