My name's James Cate, and I am a senior at UTK.  Im pursuing a CS degree with minors in cybersecurity and business administration. 
I am interested in medical applications, machine learning, neuroscience, music, and outdoor recreation.  I am looking forward to learning
a lot and meeting new people this semester.
