My name is Axel Hranov. I am an undergrad CS Major, planning on graduating at the end of this semester (Hopefully~).
I currently work at UTK's Office of Information Technology HelpDesk, and participated in NIMBioS's 2017 Summer Research Experience where I helped make a game/simulation to help teach biology to kids.


My interests include playing/creating Video games, watching Movies/TV Shows, cooking, origami, and other things I can't think of at the top of my head.
I am also very interested in VR and its continuing growth. I have a Vive, and am learning about making VR games which I hope will eventually make me money.
