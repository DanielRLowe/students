I am Julian Swart and I am in the Business Analytics Master's program. I did my undergraduate at NC State and received my degree in 
Textile Technology. After that I worked for my family selling furniture for two years while earning a Business Certificate. This 
past summer I interned at Pilot in their Business Intelligence department and learned my passion for data science. I have never 
taken a CSC course before, but I am interested in furthering my coding abilites and data analysis skills.
